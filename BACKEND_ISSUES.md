# Notification Optimization - Backend Issues Found

## Issues Identified in Backend NotificationService.js:

### 1. Potential Bug in `sendFollowNotification`:
The function signature is `sendFollowNotification(followerId, followedId)` but the parameters seem to be used inconsistently in the implementation. Make sure:
- `followerId` is the user performing the follow action (sender)
- `followedId` is the user being followed (recipient)

### 2. Route Inconsistency:
The FCM token check route uses body validation but should use query validation:
```javascript
// Current (incorrect):
router.get('/fcm-token/check',
    [
        body('token').notEmpty().withMessage('FCM token is required')  // Should be query
    ],

// Should be:
router.get('/fcm-token/check',
    [
        query('token').notEmpty().withMessage('FCM token is required')
    ],
```

### 3. Missing Navigation Types:
The backend doesn't handle navigation for `group_added` notifications properly in the switch statement.

### 4. Consider adding error handling:
For production robustness, consider adding more comprehensive error handling in notification delivery.

## Recommendations:
1. Fix the FCM token check route validation
2. Add comprehensive logging for debugging notification delivery issues
3. Consider implementing retry logic for failed notifications
4. Add rate limiting for notification sending to prevent spam
